# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis (EDA Project)

This project explores the heart disease dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and potential risk factors related to cardiovascular health. The focus is on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using statistical summaries and visualizations.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [heart.csv from The Data Analysis Workshop](https://github.com/PacktWorkshops/The-Data-Analysis-Workshop/blob/master/Chapter07/Dataset/heart.csv)
- **Rows**: 303 patients  
- **Columns**: 14 features (age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol, thalach, etc.)  
- **Target variable**: `target` (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Descriptive statistics  
- Visual exploration: histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, countplots  
- Correlation analysis  
- Group-wise comparison by target class

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Understand how patient attributes relate to heart disease  
- Visualize differences between patients with and without heart disease  
- Identify patterns across age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more

---

## ✅ Key Insights

- Males represent the majority of patients with heart disease in this dataset  
- Chest pain type (`cp`) and max heart rate (`thalach`) show clear variation across target classes  
- No strong linear correlation between cholesterol and heart disease, but combined features reveal insights  
- Age group 50–60 appears most affected

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python, Pandas, NumPy  
Matplotlib, Seaborn  
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
